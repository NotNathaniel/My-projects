This code takes loan data (of which I am not allowed to share) and predicts whether the loans will default using basic machine learning algorithms.

The scikit algorithms used are:
-Logistic Regression
-Linear Discriminant Analysis
-Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
-Tree based methods
-Boosting
-k Nearest Neighbors
