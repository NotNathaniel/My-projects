This code generates balls of various sizes and colors within a frame according to user specifications which then move around. 
Upon interactions the larger balls "bite" the smaller balls consuming a piece of them. This process proceeds indefinitely although it eventually
only displays a single ball which has consumed everything. 

BoxOfFrame is essentially the main script where:
-Box creates the box which the balls reside in.
-Ball generates the balls
-Vector contains the physical laws of "Box".
